ShokoMetadata.bundle
====================
This is a plex library metadata currently written for anything on AniDB.

## Notes
Naming episodes/series works best with [This format](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200220687-Naming-Series-Season-Based-TV-Shows) unless using the "Shoko Series scanner"

- I reccomend installing the Shoko Series scanner into the `Scanners/Series` folder for better compatibility.
- DO change the preferences to match what you have.
